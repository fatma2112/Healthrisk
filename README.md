# Health Insurance Risk Calculator

This is a web app that helps calculate health risks for insurance customers based on their age, height, weight, blood pressure, and family health history. The app provides a risk level (low, moderate, high, or uninsurable) along with a risk score.

## 🚀 How it Works

1. Users input their age, height, weight, blood pressure, and family health history.
2. The app validates the inputs (e.g., height must be ≥ 60 cm).
3. It calculates the BMI and assesses risk based on medical metrics.
4. The risk level is displayed (low, moderate, high, or uninsurable).
